# Note-Log

A Note log is a simple prioritized list of the tasks a person must complete. People make a list of everything they need to do, ranked according to priority from the most critical task at the top to the least critical task at the bottom. Note logs are quickly made entries of the tasks or the atomic entities. 

To be sure, note log terminology like "Office meeting" or "buy new laptop" are frequently very short notes. Because the signal is so quick, it is only useful for a short period of time while the task is remembered. Note logs directly add to the person’s productivity system. The functionalities provided by a good Note log application help clear up the user’s mind as their pending tasks are recorded safely and they won’t be forgotten. 

The Note log project is a user-friendly website which helps them to keep track of their tasks. It is a simple site which requires no sign-in/log-in or any personal details but still records your task, along with time, day and date the note is created, marks the completed tasks, and stores them even if you visit the site after a few days.
